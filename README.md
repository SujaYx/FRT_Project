# Frt_project
This is my conceptual idea of creating this website on this problem, as I had also faced this problem during my period of selecting my university or college. As of now, I am only able to design the frontend of the website, as it requires huge resources to complete this project.
To solve the problem discussed above, I created the UniQuest website, which provides all the information regarding admission to universities and all the top university data.
The need for the UniQuest website is among the students who pass 12th grade every year, as it will provide them with all the information about the universities they will choose ahead.

UniQuest helps students by:
1. Search and filter
2. Search and filter
3.Comparison Tool
4. Scholarship and Financial Aid Information
5. Student Reviews and Testimonials
6. Interactive Chatbot Assistance

These all features of the website will help the students find their dream university and save them the time of searching for colleges and universities on different sites and places.

you can ask the chatbot the following questions:
1.How can I get in touch with UniQuest for further assistance
2.Does UniQuest provides information onadmission requirements?
3. What is Uniquest ?
4. Can I read reviews from current or former students on UniQuest?
5. How can I compare Universities using UniQuest?
6. What services do you provide?
